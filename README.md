** MySQL **

With well over 10 million installations, MySQL is probably the most popular database
management system for web servers. Developed in the mid-1990s, it’s now a mature
technology that powers many of today’s most-visited Internet destinations.
One reason for its success must be the fact that, like PHP, it’s free to use. But it’s also
extremely powerful and exceptionally fast—it can run on even the most basic of
hardware, and it hardly puts a dent in system resources.
